Nextcloud deployment via docker-compose

This project uses apache as the web server, mariadb as the database, and traefik for management of let's encrypt certificates. 
The traefik container is separated and can very easily be extended to provide traffic management to other docker-compose projects via networks (see network definitions in source)

This project requires split dns / host overrides for traefik to route traffic to the nextcloud and traefik dashboard services (as well as others should you care to extend it). 


known bugs: android/ios/windows devices (app) hang on initial log in. This can be remedied with 'old login' option (if available) or app token. SOLUTION FOUND: this issue seems to be due to some (but not all) links generated by nextcloud being http, the link that causes the problem is the form submission button. Solution is to add this line to config/config.php in nextcloud container volume :

'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',

This will be remedied automatically in future commits, hopefully without use of a dockerfile.




Instructions:


-Copy traefik and nextcloud directories to location of docker projects
-Change example variables in both docker-compose.yml files
-"docker-compose up -d"in traefik directory then nextcloud directory
-nextcloud will be available for admin acct set up at nextcloudhostname.local.domain
-traefik dashboard will be available at traefikhostname.local.domain/dashboard/
